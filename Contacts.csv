The salad was placed directly into a ceramic bowl from the bag, so there is no other possibility of the plastic piece coming from anywhere but the bag. I am very concerned that there were potentially other small pieces of the plastic mixed into the salad that I swallowed. I have photos of the plastic, as well as the bag the salad came from.
