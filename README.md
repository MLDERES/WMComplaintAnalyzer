# Walmart Customer Complaint Analyzer

Placeholder here so that I can build out a NLP system to automate the customer complaints generated monthly in Walmart's system.

## Installation

Coming soon!!


## Usage

Pull information out of UBXLink in CSV format and add to the same folder. Currently it will build out a word cloud based on the Verbatim of the customer complaints.
